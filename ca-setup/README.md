Simple scripts to quickly setup CA (certificate authority) for testing purposes.

## Contents

* [setup-ca](setup-ca)
  * Create CA and signing certificates
* [create-cert](create-cert)
  * Create a new certificate for a host
* [create-req](create-req)
  * Create a new certificate signing request

To use the scripts make a copy of them into a dedicated directory,
tweak them as needed, and use them to setup CA and create certificates.
